      Namaste internet and welcome to my first web page!  As you have likely deduced, my name is Drew Wagner.  I am an aspiring web developer, biochemist, and student of the world.  I have been a resident of Texas for 4 years, having moved to Austin in 2012 for a graduate program in biochemistry at UT Austin. Depending on who you ask, grad school may not offer many perks but one nice feature is that grad students get free tuition and can take any class they want.  So, in my exploitation of free classes, I have taken several introductory computer science courses and, finding them interesting am now beginning to dive into web development.  It is my hope that this humble page will be the first of many as well as a stepping stone on my path to mastery of the stack. in addition to my bourgening coding skills, I am also a former pet owner. But these days the closest thing I have to an animal companion would either be my housemate or the basil plant that I am cultivating for pesto production.
